This high detail model is a free sample of my artistic ability. Reviews would be much appreciated.

This pirate vessel is designed to disable a target and then lock on and deploy a boarding party.
The airlock is large enough to accomidate heavy assault vehicles for this purpose.
The ship has a rather junked up, hodge-podge look due to constant jury-rigged repairs and salvaged scrap metal leaves protecting the hull.
With the skull and crossbones across the hull and an impressive array of fire power including anti-fighter turrets,
EMP emiters, and a heavy assault cannon salvaged from an alien cruiser, this ship would strike fear into the heart of any opponent.
